# Animal Nest

Animal Nest is a school-based platform for homeless animals, which provides a space for students and volunteers to connect, communicate and learn more about the homeless animals on campus.

Key technologies: Java, Wechat Mini Program (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Mybatis, Spring Boot, MySQL, ImgURL.

# Inspiration

When I was studying for my bachelor's degree, I noticed that many homeless animals, mostly cats, lived on campus. Students often enjoyed feeding and playing with them, and there was even a campus animal protection association. However, several challengs arose:

For Students:
1. Some students were unware of the temperament of homeless animals and would get too close to agreesive ones, sometimes resulting in injuries.
2. Many students didn't know what kind of food was safe for these animals and would accidentlly leave food that was harmful to them.
3. Some Students weren't aware of the animal protection association and didn't know what to do when they encountered an injured animal.

For Volunteers:
1. Volunteers had the necessary knowledge but lacked an effective way to educate students.
2. It was difficult for them to keep track of all the homeless animals and monitor their conditions.

Seeing these issues, I came up with the idea of building a platform to connect students and volunteers. Volunteers could use it to share infomation about homeless animals and provide educational resources, while students could post updates, share their experiences, and report urgent issues. The platform would also allow them to communicate easily with each other.

With this vision, I developed Animal Nest, a platform built using Java and WeChat Mini Program, to bridge the gap between students and volunteers in caring for homeless animals on campus.

# What it does

Animal Information: Volunteers can upload basic details about homeless animals, and students can browse this information. Students can also save their favorite animals to track their conditions.

Posting: Students can share their experiences with these animals, as well as like and comment on other posts.

Notices: Volunteers can post important updates, educational content, and announcements about association activities.

Feedback: Students can report the condition of homeless animals to volunteers, helping them stay informed and provide timely assistance.
